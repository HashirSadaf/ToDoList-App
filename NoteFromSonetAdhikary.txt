Hi,this is Sonet.I've fixed the firebase database connection issue for your app.Here is some important notes for you-

1.When importing firebase tools(like firestore) make sure you replace the 'SERVICE to the service name.Here is an example-
import { initializeApp } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.6.10/firebase-app.js';


2.Make sure you've added the type="module" in your index.html file when inserting the <script></script> tag.

3.Make sure export the db and import it in script.js file.

4.I think you have used the old syntax of firebase.Like db.collection.But in firebase 9,eatch function like collection has exported individually.

5.I've just configure the firestore database for you.If you need the Auth,you can use the same steps to add user authentication in your project.
